# A New Spine for Teichmueller Space of Closed Hyperbolic Surfaces


[Edited 2024-01-30]

The problem of constructing a minimal dimension spine of Teichmueller space is rather famous open question. We have been thinking about it for a long time, but recently during the CMS 2023 in Montreal we were inspired to review it. In fact we think we finally understand exactly the codimension of the spine. It's directly related to the homology of the surface, i.e. 2g-1 is equal to dim H_1(S)-1 and this is no coincidence. 

Our retract has some notable ingredients.

1. We modify Thurston's original proposal and emphasize essential nonseparating geodesic curves in the surface. Thus we focus exclusively on homological curves.
2. We directly use Teichmueller's idea of quadratic differentials as infinitesimal deformations of hyperbolic structure by constructing quadratic holomorphic differentials from canonical harmonic one forms on the surface. The construction of the harmonic one forms is interesting variational lemma.
3. In Belt Tightening Lemma we prove that the lengths of curves are simultaneously increased by Teichmueller deformations in the direction of the canonical harmonic one forms constructed above. This is a direct computation of the lengths and readily follows from the construction of the harmonic one form.

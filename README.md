# MCG

The article MCG.pdf is a work in progress, describing some applications of our PhD thesis to the mapping class group (MCG) of compact Riemann surfaces.
The article is specially focussed on a problem we call *Closing the Steinberg Symbol* (CS). 
Solutions of (CS) are finite subsets I of MCG which allow us to replace the Teichmueller space Teich with a chain sum F, and applying the Reduction-to-Singularity method of our thesis we produce subvarieties Z of Teich which are candidate MCG-equivariant spines of Teich.
In this article we do not elaborate the construction of Z, nor the deformation retracts of Teich onto Z, but focus on the symbolic computational problem of (CS).

We pose several problem/questions:

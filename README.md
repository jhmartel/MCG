The file newteich.pdf is an article in progress which describes the applications of our PhD thesis to the mapping class group 
of genus two hyperbolic surfaces. The purpose of the article is to summarize, in concrete terms, a computational problem which
we hope that Mark Bell's program Curver [https://markcbell.github.io/build/html/index.html] can solve.

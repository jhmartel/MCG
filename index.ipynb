    "Let $S$ be a closed compact connected hyperbolic surface. In this article we prove the following\n",

    "**Main Theorem.** *A minimal dimension equivariant spine $W$ of Teichmueller space $Teich(S)$ consists of surfaces which are filled by their shortest essential nonseparating geodesics.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The spine $W$ is distinct from W. Thurston's original construction [@thurston1986spine], the key difference being our emphasis on essential *nonseparating* curves. The complete proof of our Main Theorem requires constructing a continuous mapping class group equivariant strong deformation retract of $Teich(S)$ onto $W$, and proving that $W$ has codimension equal to $2g-1$ in $Teich(S)$. To construct continuous retractions requires canonical tangent vectors, and this is addressed in Lemma \\ref{can} which constructs harmonic one forms $\\phi$ on the surface adapted to short nonseparating curves. Our observation is the Belt Tightening Lemma \\ref{belt} in  \\S \\ref{s2} which says: whenever short nonseparating curves are non filling, we can *simultaneously increase* their lengths by flowing along a Teichmueller deformation in the \"direction of $\\phi$\". We iterate the construction of $\\phi$ and the Teichmueller deformations to obtain a sequence of continuous retracts $W_j \\to W_{j+1}$ whose composition yields the desired deformation retract of Teichmueller space onto $W$. \n",

    "We begin with some definitions and notation. Let $(S,g)$ be a closed hyperbolic surface with constant Gauss curvature $\\kappa=-1$.  A collection of curves is *essential* if the curves are homotopically nontrivial. The collection is *nonseparating* if the curves are nonzero in $H_1(S, \\bf{Z})$. Let $C=C(g)$ denote the set of all geodesic nonseparating essential curves on $(S,g)$. Let $C_0$ be an arbitrary subset of $C$. The complexity of $C_0$ is defined as the rank of the homological image of $C_0$, namely $$\\xi(C_0):=\\dim \\text{span} (H_1(C_0)).$$ We observe $\\xi=\\xi(C_0)$ is an integer taking every integral value between $1 \\leq \\xi \\leq 2g$ where $g$ is the genus of the surface $S$. A collection of curves $C_0$ *fills the surface* $S$ if the complement $S-C_0$ is a disjoint union of topological disks. We define the $C$-systoles of $(S,g)$ to be the shortest curves in $C$ relative to $g$-length. We emphasize that $C$ consists of essential *nonseparating* geodesics. The $C$-systoles of a given metric $g$ are denoted by $C'=C'(g)$. \n",

    "\\end{lem}\n",
    "\\begin{proof} \n",
    "By definition $C_0$ consists of essential nonseparating curves, and their homological image generates a subspace $H'$ in $H_1$. By classification of surfaces, the complement $S-C'$ is a disjoint union of surfaces with geodesic corners and topological types $S_{g,b}$ for various values of $g \\geq 0$, $b \\geq 1$. If $C'$ does not fill $S$, then by definition there exists some connected component $S_{g,b}$ with $g+b \\geq 2$. We have two cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "(Case 1) If $g>0$, then it's evident there exists a nonseparating interior homology curve on $S_{g,b}$ which injects into $H_1(S)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Case 2) If $g=0$ then our assumptions imply the component has topological type $S_{0,b}$ with $b\\geq 2$. This implies there exists nontrivial relative one cycles in $S_{0,b}$ modulo $\\partial S_{0,b}$. This nonzero relative one cycle extends nonuniquely to some nonseparating curve $\\hat{\\beta}$ in $S$. We claim the nonunique homology cycle $[\\hat{\\beta}]$ is linearly independant from $H'$. This follows from Poincare-Lefschetz duality. \n",

    "\\section{Canonical Harmonic One Forms Adapted to $C$-Systoles}\\label{s3}\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of equivariant retracts of Teichmueller space requires defining \"canonical flow directions\". This is subtle and crucial aspect of global continuous retracts, and leads to controversy especially with respect to Thurston's preprint [@thurston1986spine]. In the following lemma we apply a simple variational idea to define canonical harmonic one forms depending on $C'$. These harmonic one forms are crucial in defining the specific \"Teichmueller flow\" retracting onto the spine.\n",

    "\\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \\ref{canon}] Consider the homological image $H':=H_1(C')$ in $H_1(S)$. The annihilator $Ann(H')$ of $H'$ in $H^1(S)$ consists of one forms $\\psi$ which satisfy $\\int_\\alpha \\psi=0$ for all $\\alpha\\in H'$. If $C'$ does not fill $S$, then $H' \\neq H^1(S)$ and $Ann(H')$ is a nonzero subspace of $H^1(S)$. Now consider the closed convex subset $K'$ of all one forms $\\phi$ which satisfy $\\int_\\alpha \\phi \\geq 1$ for all $\\alpha \\in H'$. From the definitions it's clear this subset is nonempty if and only if $C'$ is not filling. Now we observe that there exists a uniquely defined $L^2$ shortest one form $\\phi_0$ in $K'$. This shortest one form is orthogonal to $Ann(H')$, i.e. we have $\\iint_S \\alpha \\wedge \\beta^*=0$ for all $\\beta \\in Ann(H')$. By Hodge's theorem $\\phi_0$ is uniquely represented as a harmonic one form. This shortest harmonic one form $\\phi=\\phi_0$ is the desired canonical one form. \n",
    "\\end{proof}\n",
    "\n",
    "For our applications we remark that the canonical one form $\\phi=\\phi_0$ constructed in Lemma \\ref{canon} varies continuously with respect to variations in the hyperbolic metric $g$ when the dimension of the homological span $H'(g):=H_1(C'(g))$ is constant. \n",

    "\\end{lem}\n",
    "\\begin{proof}\n",
    "The proof is trivial. The $C$-systoles $C'(g)$ of the hyperbolic metric $g$ is upper semicontinuous with respect to variations in the metric, i.e. if $g_k$ is a sequence of hyperbolic metrics with limit $\\lim_k g_k=g_\\infty$, then $C'(g_\\infty)$ contains the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $C'(g_k)$. In simple terms, this means short vectors are preserved and there is possibility of *new* short vectors appearing in the limit. This implies that $Ann(H')$ and $K'$ are *lower* semicontinuous with respect to $g$. Therefore $K'(g_\\infty)$ is always contained in the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $K'(g_k)$. All of these subsets are Gromov-Hausdorff continuous when the spans $H'=H'(g)$ vary continuously with respect to $g$, and this iff the dimensions are constant. \n",

Teichmueller theory identifies infinitesimal variations of hyperbolic metrics with the real parts of holomorphic quadratic differentials. See [@teich1939, Ch. 17, \\S 60-63], [@handbookV]. Thus if $g_t$ is a variation of hyperbolic metrics, then $g'_t = Re(q)$ where $q$ is a holomorphic quadratic differential and $Re(-)$ denotes the real part. The harmonic one forms $\\phi=\\phi_0$ constructed in Lemma \\ref{canon} define holomorphic quadratic differentials on $S$ by setting $q:=(\\phi+i\\phi^*)^2$. Consequently $Re(q)=\\phi \\phi - \\phi^*\\phi^*$ and therefore infinitesimal deformations $dg$ of the hyperbolic metric $g$ in the \"$\\phi$-direction\" are approximately equal to $dg=(\\phi\\phi - \\phi^*\\phi^*)$ plus higher order terms. \n",

It's also clear that $\\xi$ can increase along convergent sequences, and this occurs precisely when \"new\" homologically independant short curves appear in the limit. Standard results from ODEs imply that solutions to the (\\eqref{ivp}) exist uniquely and vary continuously with respect to initial conditions only if $\\xi$ is everywhere constant.

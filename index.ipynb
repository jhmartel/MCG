    "**Main Theorem.** *A minimal dimension equivariant spine $W$ of Teichmueller space $T$ consists of hyperbolic surfaces which are homologically filled by their shortest essential nonseparating curves.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The spine $W$ is distinct from W. Thurston's original construction [@thurston1986spine], the key difference being our emphasis on essential nonseparating curves and their homological filling properties. The complete proof of our Main Theorem requires constructing a strong deformation retract of $T$ onto $W$ which is invariant with respect to mapping class group, and prove that $W$ has codimension equal to $2g-1$. Our construction clarifies the numerical coincidence between $\\dim T - vcd (MCG(S))=2g-1$ and $\\dim H_1(S)-1$. Compare [@broaddus2012homology], [@harer1986virtual]. To construct continuous retractions requires canonical tangent vectors, and this is addressed in Lemma \\ref{canon} which constructs canonical harmonic one forms $\\phi$ on the surface adapted to short nonseparating curves. Our main observation is Belt Tightening Lemma \\ref{belt} in  \\S \\ref{s2} which says if short nonseparating curves are not homologically filling, then we can *simultaneously increase* their lengths by flowing along a Teichmueller deformation in the \"direction of $\\phi$\". We iterate the construction of $\\phi$ and the Teichmueller deformations to obtain a sequence of continuous retracts $W_j \\to W_{j+1}$ whose composition yields the desired deformation retract of Teichmueller space onto $W$. \n",

    "Let $(S,g)$ be a closed hyperbolic surface with constant Gauss curvature $\\kappa=-1$.  A collection of curves is *essential* if the curves are homotopically nontrivial. The collection is *nonseparating* if the curves are nonzero in $H_1(S):=H_1(S, \\bf{Z})$. Let $C=C(g)$ denote the set of all geodesic nonseparating essential curves on $(S,g)$. A subset of geodesic nonseparating curves $C' \\subset C$ with the property that the inclusion $i: C' \\to S$ induces a homological isomorphism $H_1(i): H_1(C') \\to H_1(S)$ is called *homologically filling* in $S$.  \n",

    "We define the *$C$-systoles* of $(S,g)$ to be the shortest curves in $C$ relative to the hyperbolic metric $g$. We emphasize that $C$ consists of essential *nonseparating* geodesics. The $C$-systoles of a given metric $g$ are denoted by $C'=C'(g)$. The *complexity* of a hyperbolic metric $g$ is defined as the dimension of the homological image generated by the $C$-systoles $C'(g)$. That is $$\\xi(g):=\\dim \\text{span} (H_1(C'(g))).$$ We observe $\\xi=\\xi(g)$ is an integer taking every integral value between $1 \\leq \\xi \\leq 2\\text{gen}(S)$.

See [@teich1939, Ch. 17, \\S 60-63], [@handbookV].

In simple terms, this means short vectors are preserved and there is possibility of new short vectors appearing in the limit. Therefore the dimension possibly increases. This implies that $Ann(H')$ and $K'$ are lower semicontinuous with respect to $g$. Therefore $K'(g_\\infty)$ is always contained in the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $K'(g_k)$.

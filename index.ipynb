    "The spine $W$ is distinct from W. Thurston's original construction [@thurston1986spine], the key difference being our emphasis on essential nonseparating curves which homologically fill the surface. The complete proof of our Main Theorem requires constructing a strong deformation retract of $T$ onto $W$ which is invariant with respect to mapping class group, and prove that $W$ has codimension equal to $2g-1$. Our construction clarifies the numerical coincidence between $\\dim T - vcd (MCG(S))=2g-1$ and $\\dim H_1(S)-1$. Compare [@broaddus2012homology], [@harer1986virtual]. To construct continuous retractions requires canonical tangent vectors, and this is addressed in Lemma \\ref{canon} which constructs canonical harmonic one forms $\\phi$ on the surface adapted to short nonseparating curves. Our main observation is Belt Tightening Lemma \\ref{belt} in  \\S \\ref{s2} which says if short nonseparating curves are not homologically filling, then we can *simultaneously increase* their lengths by flowing along a Teichmueller deformation in the \"direction of $\\phi$\". We iterate the construction of $\\phi$ and the Teichmueller deformations to obtain a sequence of continuous retracts $W_j \\to W_{j+1}$ whose composition yields the desired deformation retract of Teichmueller space onto $W$. \n",

    "The construction of equivariant retracts of Teichmueller space requires defining \"canonical flow directions\". This is subtle and crucial aspect of global continuous retracts, and leads to controversy especially with respect to Thurston's preprint [@thurston1986spine], [@bd]. In the following lemma we apply a simple variational idea to define canonical harmonic one forms depending on $C'$. These harmonic one forms are crucial in defining the specific \"Teichmueller flow\" retracting onto the spine.\n",

    "\\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \\ref{canon}] Consider the homological image $H':=H_1(C')$ in $H_1(S)$. The annihilator $Ann(H')$ of $H'$ in $H^1(S)$ consists of one forms $\\psi$ which satisfy $\\int_\\alpha \\psi=0$ for all $\\alpha\\in H'$. If $C'$ does not fill $S$, then $H' \\neq H^1(S)$ and $Ann(H')$ is a nonzero subspace of $H^1(S)$. Now consider the closed convex subset $K'$ of all one forms $\\psi$ which satisfy $\\int_\\alpha \\psi = 1$ for all $\\alpha \\in H'$. From the definitions it's clear this subset is nonempty and disjoint from $0$ if and only if $C'$ is not homologically filling. Next we observe there exists a uniquely defined $L^2$ shortest one form $\\psi_0$ in $K'$. By Hodge's theorem there exists a unique harmonic one form $\\phi$ representing $\\psi_0$. This means the pointwise identity holds $\\phi|_x \\wedge \\phi^*|_x = ||\\phi_x|| dS$ for all $x\\in S$. Clearly $\\phi$ satisfies (i) and it remains to prove that $\\phi$ satisfies (ii). We observe that $\\phi$ is by construction orthogonal to $Ann(H')$, i.e. $\\iint_S \\phi^* \\wedge \\beta=0$ for all $\\beta \\in Ann(H')$. This implies $\\phi^* \\in Ann(H')$ and $\\int_\\alpha \\phi^*=0$ for all $\\alpha \\in H'$. We conclude our argument with Claim (ii) that the integrand $\\phi^*(\\alpha')=0$ vanishes for all $\\alpha \\in C'$. We argue that this follows from Dirichlet's Hydrodynamic First Existence Theorem \\cite{cohn2014conformal}. Indeed (ii) asserts that the harmonic one-form $\\phi$ further satisfies the abelian condition $\\phi^*=0$ on $C'$.\n",

    "Let $j=1,2,\\ldots$ be an integer. We define $W_j$ to be the subset of $T:=Teich(S)$ consisting of hyperbolic metrics $g$ such that $\\xi(g) \\geq j$. The subset $W_j$ is a closed subset of $T$. In fact we claim $W_j$ has dimension equal to $j-1$, see section \\ref{s4} below. \n",

    "The canonical harmonic one form $\\phi=\\phi_0$ constructed in Lemma \\ref{canon} varies continuously with respect to the hyperbolic metric $g$ on $S$ if and only if $\\xi$ is constant along the variation. \n",
    "\\end{lem}\n",
    "\\begin{proof}\n",
    "The proof is trivial given the hypotheses. The $C$-systoles $C'(g)$ of the hyperbolic metric $g$ is upper semicontinuous with respect to variations in the metric, i.e. if $g_k$ is a sequence of hyperbolic metrics with limit $\\lim_k g_k=g_\\infty$, then $C'(g_\\infty)$ contains the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $C'(g_k)$. In simple terms, this means short vectors are preserved and there is possibility of new short vectors appearing in the limit. This implies that $Ann(H')$ and $K'$ are lower semicontinuous with respect to $g$. Therefore $K'(g_\\infty)$ is always contained in the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of $K'(g_k)$. All of these subsets are Gromov-Hausdorff continuous when the spans $H'=H'(g)$ vary continuously with respect to $g$ and this occurs iff the dimension $\\xi$ is constant. \n",
    "\\end{proof}\n",
    "\n",
    "When the limit is upper discontinuous, then the limit metric $g_\\infty$ admits a new homologically independant short curve. The affine subspace $K'(g_\\infty)$ is then a strictly proper subset of $\\text{GH}-\\lim_k K'(g_k)$. Therefore it's evident that the least $g_\\infty$-energy one form $\\phi_0(g_\\infty)$ is likely not equal to the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the least energy $\\text{GH}-\\lim_k \\phi_0(g_k)$ one forms. \n"

    "Belt Tightening is proved by constructing the metrics $g_t$ as solutions of an initial value problem of an ODE. In otherwords we define infinitesimal deformations of the hyperbolic metric. Teichmueller theory identifies infinitesimal variations $dg$ of hyperbolic metrics $g$ with the real parts of holomorphic quadratic differentials. See [@teich1939, Ch. 17, \\S 60-63], [@handbookV]. Therefore if $dg$ is a variation of hyperbolic metrics, then $dg = Re(q)$ where $q$ is a holomorphic quadratic differential and $Re(q)$ is its real part. The harmonic one forms $\\phi=\\phi_0$ constructed in Lemma \\ref{canon} provide holomorphic quadratic differentials on $S$ by setting $q:=(\\phi+i\\phi^*)^{\\otimes 2}$, which implies $Re(q)=\\phi \\phi - \\phi^*\\phi^*$. Our retractions depend on defining the complex squareroot $q^{1/2}$ which has $Re(q^{1/2})=\\sqrt{\\phi \\phi - \\phi^* \\phi^*}$, and this provides a canonical direction along which we infitesimally deform the metric $g+dg$.\n",
